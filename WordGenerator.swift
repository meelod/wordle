  // Exercise 8: Add more possible words and return a **random** string every time `generateRandomWord` is called
  // IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE ALL THE LETTERS IN THE NEW WORDS YOU ADD ARE CAPITALIZED (e.g. "AUDIO" instead of "audio")
  // Tip: Look at the Array API documentation to see what method returns a random element
  // Checkpoint: After finishing this exercise, you should now have a different goal word each time you run the app! Try printing out the selected goal word to check. If it's not working, check that you have done this exercise correctly.
